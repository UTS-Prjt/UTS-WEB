                <p class="text">In 1950’s he popularized the Field of  Semiology (the study of objects as signs). A Sign is anything that conveys meaning. It was Barthes who revealed that everyday objects are not just things but a complex system of signs which allows one to read meaning into people and places. What people increasingly produce are not material objects, but signs.</p>
